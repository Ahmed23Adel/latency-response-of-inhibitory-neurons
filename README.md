latency response of inhibitory neurons

This was a project for my internship in computational neuroscience at Neuromatach academy, i was in charge of Data analysis and extracting information from our raw data.

Our question was about how VIP neurons will react differently to any stimuli according to the familiarity with the stimuli.
We used the Allen dataset; it was showing a set of stimuli sequentially with some gaps, and with the help of neuropixels, it recorded the time neurons take to respond after the stimuli, an image was reshown every 0.75 seconds, and it lasts for 0.25 seconds only.
 
sample of showing stimuli:

So we averaged the response time for all sessions of all experiments and got that graph

there was a clear negative correlation between the familiarity level and response time of neurons

And generally found out that if the image was crystal novel for the mouser vs familiar:

Great thanks for NMA and greate instructors and TA, who mentored and helped us a lot.
